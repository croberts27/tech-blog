## Description

This project builds a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers’ posts as well. This app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, uses Handlebars.js as the templating language, uses Sequelize as the ORM, and uses the express-session npm package for authentication.
