## Description

This project builds a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. This app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, uses Handlebars.js as the templating language, uses Sequelize as the ORM, and uses the express-session npm package for authentication.
